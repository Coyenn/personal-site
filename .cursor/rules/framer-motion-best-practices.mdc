- Use `animate` and `initial` props for simple animations without additional hooks.
- Implement `variants` for complex animations to keep your component code clean.
- Utilize `useAnimation` for more control over animation triggers and sequences.
- Optimize performance by using `layout` prop for smooth transitions during DOM changes.
