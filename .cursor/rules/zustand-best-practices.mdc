- Create separate stores for different domains to keep state management organized.
- Use middleware like `devtools` for debugging and `persist` for state persistence.
- Implement selectors to optimize re-renders by only subscribing to necessary state slices.
- Use TypeScript with Zustand to ensure type safety in your state management.
