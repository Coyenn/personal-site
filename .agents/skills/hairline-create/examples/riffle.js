/**
 * Riffle: a rounded tray holding eight cards. The card under the pointer
 * stands up and lifts; the ones in front lean forward and the ones behind lean
 * back, staggered outwards from it on the 700ms lift curve. Each card's number
 * is punched on its tab in a 4 × 2 grid, and goes to the read-out when the
 * card is pulled. The slider is the stagger, in ms.
 *
 * The pattern: discrete items. Tweens, a stagger by distance, identity carried
 * by geometry, and a hit test on static bands along the resting top edges, so
 * a card moving out from under the pointer cannot flip the choice.
