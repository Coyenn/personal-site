### Backstory

Since starting my career in IT, I've used a wide variety of code editors and IDEs. My first ever line of code was actually written in an IDE called ["Roblox Studio"](https://www.roblox.com/create) which is used to create games on the Roblox platform.
Now this is a very unknown IDE and at the time, even today, it lacks many basic features that are considered standard in modern editors.
So I quickly moved onto other, more capable editors such as JetBrains' [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

### Visual Studio Code, the best of both worlds?

But here's the thing, I don't like slow, bloated software. When I'm writing code, I want to work quickly and efficiently. 5 minutes of indexing and loading is, atleast for me, unacceptable.

This is where [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) comes in. It's fast, lightweight, open source and free. There's a huge community creating extensions for it and it's available on all major platforms.
For me, it simply ticks all the right boxes.

I feel like it's the perfect balance between a full blown IDE and a simple text editor.

### The switch to Zed

As of a couple of weeks ago, I've been a happy user of VSCode.
But recently I started looking for something new, something that's even faster, even more lightweight and powerful.

And that's when learned about [Zed](https://zed.dev/). Written entirely in Rust using a custom UI framework makes it extremely fast, probably the fastest editor on the market right now.

That sounds almost too good to be true, where's the catch?<br />
Well, there are a few.
First of all, Zed is still in beta <small>(v110.2)</small>.
Half a year ago, a lot of core features where missing. Since then, the editor has matured a lot but many functionalities, languages and other things are still on the roadmap.
It's currently only available for macOS. Windows and Linux support is planned but there's no ETA yet.

### Why am I using it then?

To put it simply, Zed has everything I need for my day to day work. It supports all the languages I regularly use, it works seamlessly with [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) and most importantly, it has Vim emulation.

### Would I recommend Zed?

If you're on MacOS and are looking for a fast, lightweight editor then yes, absolutely.
Zed is available for free on their [website](https://zed.dev/), so I recommend you give it a try. Especially if you're using Rust or TypeScript on a daily basis.

If a language or feature you need is missing, you can always [open an issue](https://github.com/zed-industries/community/issues) on Zed's GitHub or upvote an existing one to help the developers prioritize.
